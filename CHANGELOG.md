# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.

## [0.4.2]

### Fixed
- Database does not have the correct schema version on initial plugin installation due to the data folder not existing yet causing error on future startups.

## [0.4.1]

### Added
- Support for Minecraft 1.21.6

### Changed
- Complete visualizer render displays selectable corner blocks.
- Visualizer carpet displays the matching color for the type of terracotta it's overlaying.
- All selectable visualiser corners are now blue regardless of mode.

## [0.4.0]
New major beta feature drop! Quality of life changes all around and support for 1.21.5.

### Added
- Support for Minecraft 1.21.5
- Protection against players stealing animals by putting them in vehicles. Bypassed by the animal vehicle flag.
- Protection against harvesting crops such as berry bushes. Requires the harvest permission.
- New "View" permission is added for viewing contents without being able to modify.
- Crops such as wheat, carrots, and cocoa beans can now be harvested with a right-click which auto replants the seeds. This can be disabled in config but allows the harvest permission to work to its fullest.
- Localizations can now automatically detect the player's own locale, falling back to the server locale if not available.
- All known missing localizations are added to the English localization file.
- Custom models can be used via resource pack to change the model of the claim and move tools.
- Custom model ids are editable via config.
- Override allows you to modify partitions as well as access and manage the claim menu.
- Leaf litter is now included in the transparency block filter.
- A new block now indicates the actively selected block while editing partitions.
- The current partition resize or add operation can be canceled by clicking on the actively selected block.
- Trying to create a claim too close to the world border is now blocked to prevent the partition from going across the border.

### Changed
- Using bone meal on crops is now covered by the harvest permission. The build permission still covers bone meal usage on non-crops.
- Armor stands can now be hit without a permission, but are still protected from destruction by Build permission.
- All languages are now included in the default lang folder on server start, with an override folder for specific admin-specifiable overrides.
- Localization file format now makes use of properties files instead of yml, using a standard key format which should better enforce localization usage over fixed strings.
- Viewing lecterns moved from redstone trigger to View permission.

### Removed
- Machine-generated translations removed, only suitable for testing but doubtful of their accuracy.

### Fixed
- Using custom Anvil GUIs may define location as (0, 0, 0), which blocks players from opening menus if a claim exists at (0, 0)
- Bell being duplicated when using the move tool.
- The Main partition isn't correctly indicated by the main partition visualizer blocks.
- Floating point error on claim creation causing partitions to generate with unusual sizes when far from the world center.
